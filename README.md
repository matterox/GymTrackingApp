# Gym Traching App

This is an Android App that I'm making for myself to keep track of gym progress.

I'm planning to use MVVP pattern, Kotlin coroutines, Flows, Firebase for storage and authentication, Jetpack Compose for UI. Later on, if there is time, I'm planning to move core buisness logic to KMP.

## TODO list to keep track:

- [ ] Authentication screen
- [ ] Buisness logic for Authentication screen (using Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Build responsive Exercise Card
- [ ] Adding Exercise to database
- [ ] Adding completed set information
- [ ] Display Exercise progression over time for each Exercise (need to research on how to do graphs in Compose)
- [ ] Github Actions to build the app
- [ ] Move buisness logic to KMP
